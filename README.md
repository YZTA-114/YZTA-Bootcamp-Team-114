  ## Product Description
  FeelEd is an AI-powered, web-based educational platform designed to help students with visual impairments access and benefit from learning materials more effectively.
  We are aware of the challenges faced by visually impaired individuals in both traditional and digital educational environments, as well as the educational inequalities caused by inaccessible content. FeelEd's long-term goals are to eliminate barriers in education, support independent learning through inclusive design and artificial intelligence technologies, and promote digital equity by ensuring that educational tools are accessible regardless of visual ability.
  In doing so, we offer a socially impactful and scalable solution for individuals and institutions, while also fostering inclusive growth in the education sector. Among our core objectives are building a strong technological infrastructure based on accessibility standards, integrating AI in an ethical and reliable manner, and establishing robust collaborations with educators and accessibility experts.

  - **Sprint Review:**
    - 

    * In the first sprint, we selected a team leader and decided on the tools we would use moving forward. We also defined some core user roles and agreed to continue with this structure in the next sprint.

    * We experienced some challenges when deciding on the main idea of the application. However, through team discussions, we managed to resolve these issues and established the foundation of the project.
    * While creating the themes and interface designs, we faced a few major difficulties. The final version of the design has not been completed yet, and we haven’t fully finalized the color palette either.
    * Throughout the process, we started using design tools like Figma and Miro more effectively, which helped improve our visual communication as a team.
    * In this sprint, we also made significant progress on the technical side. Most of the REST API structure and backend foundation was completed, providing a strong base for the development phase.
    * Overall, we accomplished all of our main goals for this sprint and created a solid plan for the next one.

    * Student and teacher registration forms will be created. The steps and content of the form will change depending on the selected user role.
    * Backend APIs will be written for core features like creating classrooms, inviting students, and uploading materials.
    * Cloudinary integration will be implemented, allowing teachers to upload image and document-type content to the platform.
    * Data will be stored using MongoDB, and the system will be tested with example data entries.
    * A connection to the Pinecone vector database will be established, and several sample educational contents will be uploaded to the system.
    * AI tools (Elevenlabs, Gen AI SDK, RAG) will start being tested to develop the voice-based tutor feature.
    * Basic page structures for the Student, Teacher, and Admin dashboards will be developed using Vue.
    * The wireframes created in Figma and Miro will be further detailed. A web-focused color palette, typography, and icon set will be finalized.
    * Basic testing will be conducted on the developed components and pages, and any bugs will be reviewed.
